**cd No Argument**
![Image](SC1.png)
The current directory was /home <br/>
The output was nothing because using cd changes the directory. If the current directory was lecture1 for example, this would move it back to home. <br/>
This output is not an error as nothing should happen if you are in the /home directory. <br/>

**cd Path to Directory**
![Image](SC2.png)
The current directory was /home <br/>
The output was that the current directory became /lecture1 and the prompt was updated. This was because the argument is what the directory was changed to. <br/>
This output is not an error as the current directory was successfully changed. <br/>

**cd Path to File**
![Image](SC3.png)
The current directory was /lecture <br/>
The output was that it said not a directory. cd can only be used for directories, not files.<br/>
This output is an error files can not be the argument for cd. <br/>
